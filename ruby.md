# ASSESSMENT 4: INTRO TO RUBY
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own there is always something more to learn.   

1. In what ways are JavaScript and Ruby similar? In what ways are they different?

  Your answer: they are both object oriented and but ruby syntax  is easier.

  Researched answer:
both are object oriented however javascript is a front end programing 
language whie ruby is back end ruby can be hard to debug and javascript 
is easier to scale up.


2. What is a hash?

  Your answer: a key value pair

  Researched answer: A Hash assigns values to keys, so that values can be looked up by their key.



3. What is the testing framework used in Ruby? Describe the process of setting up the testing environment.

  Your answer: rspec

  Researched answer:



4. Name three possible relationships between objects?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



5. What is an instance variable? How is it different from other variables in Ruby?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:An instance variable has a name beginning with @, 
  and its scope is confined to whatever object self refers to. Two different objects, 
  even if they belong to the same class, are allowed to have different values for their instance variables.
  From outside the object, instance variables cannot be altered or even observed 
  (i.e., ruby's instance variables are never public) except by whatever methods are explicitly provided by the programmer. 
  As with globals, instance variables have the nil value until they are initialized.



6. Ruby has a great community and tons of free resources to help you learn. [Here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/)is a list of great resources. Below are a few popular ones:
- [Interactive Ruby Tutorial](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- [Why's (poigniant) Guide to Ruby](http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html): comics, anecdotes, and microscopic canaries
- [Ruby in 20 Min](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
- [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)

Choose one of these resources and look through the material for 10-15 min. List three new things you learned about Ruby:

1) a method of not caring about the actual type of a variable, just relying on what methods it supports is known as “Duck Typing”

2)puts always returns nil

3)In Ruby, anything on a line after a hash mark is a comment and is ignored by the interpreter


7. STRETCH: What are blocks, procs, and lambdas?
